## 🚀 About Me  

I am a pharmacoepidemiology \& outcomes study researcher with a background spanning **biostatistics**, **clinical pharmacy/pharmacology**, and **drug safety**. Currently, I am beginning my PhD in Public Health - Pharmacoepidemiology at Rutgers University, focusing on **real-world data analytics**, **causal inference**, and **regulatory sciences** to improve medication safety and therapeutic outcomes. My research leverages large-scale health \& medical databases from diverse sources, and applies advanced quantitative methods to address pressing drug safety questions in vulnerable populations.

Before my doctoral studies, I completed my MS in Biostatistics at UC San Diego and a pharmacy degree in both China Pharmaceutical University and University of Strathclyde. I also gained industry experience at Arcus Biosciences (Clinical Pharmacology, Summer 2025) and Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine (Data Scicence \& Digital Health - Global Development, Summer 2024). Positioned at the intersection of data science, epidemiology, clinical pharmacology, and (bio-)statistics, I aim to bridge real-world applicability, and maintain a strong interest in scientific communication, public health policy, and equitable representation in patient data.
